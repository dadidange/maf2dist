# maf2dist - compute a distance matrix from an alignment

This is a small program that takes an alignment in MAF format, and computes a distance matrix from it.

## Building and Usage

All you need is a C++14 compatible compiler.

    make

Then you can invoke `maf2dist` as follows.

    ./maf2dist foo.maf

If no file name is supplied, `maf2dist` reads from `stdin` instead.
